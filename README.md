Design Goals For Project:
-Create a workout page that could track the max of 4 common lifts.
-Style for my desktop screen and mobile viewport.
-Conceptualize concepts I would like to use in the future and attempt to implement them here. 
-Get comfortable in the react ecosystem and discover points of strenghs and weaknesses.

What I Learned:
-Create reusable components that contain different information and act indepent of one another to reduce the need for creating new code.
-Transfer information between components in the form of props to get a better understand of the concept and use cases of props.
-Having a deeper understanding of the bootstrap library including buttons and form styling

What I Learned I Want To Learn:
-Get more comfortable using useState to update data dynamically and store into a variable
-Dynmaically create components in the use case that a user would like to add their own workouts to the list to track for future reference. 
-How to use TS to read/write to a file
